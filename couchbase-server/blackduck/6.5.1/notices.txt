reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ACME SOFTWARE
============================================

IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY: This ACME End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a
legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and ACME
Corporation for the ACME software product identified above, which includes
computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and
"online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). The SOFTWARE PRODUCT
also includes any updates and supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT
provided to you by ACME. Any software provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you
under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,
accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the
terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install
or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of
purchase for a full refund.


SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE
------------------------

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE
PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

  1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:

      * Applications Software. You may install, use, access, display, run, or
        otherwise interact with ("RUN") one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any
        prior version for the same operating system, on a single computer,
        workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, "smart phone," or other
        digital electronic device ("COMPUTER"). The primary user of the COMPUTER
        on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second copy for his
        or her exclusive use on a portable computer.

      * Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by
        ACME.

  2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

      * Not for Resale Software. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not For
        Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, your
        use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is limited to use for demonstration, test, or
        evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for
        value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

      * Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You
        may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,
        except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted
        by applicable law.

      * Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single
        product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than
        one COMPUTER.

      * Trademarks. This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with
        any trademarks or service marks of ACME.

      * Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

      * Support Services. ACME may provide you with support services related to
        the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is
        governed by the ACME policies and programs described in the user manual,
        in "online" documentation, and/or in other ACME-provided materials. Any
        supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support
        Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to
        the terms and conditions of this EULA.

      * Software Transfer. The initial licensee of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may make
        a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only
        directly to an end user. This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE
        PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials,
        any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
        Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any
        other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must
        agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not
        to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

      * Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate
        this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
        EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
        and all of its component parts.

  3. COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
    (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video,
    audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT),
    the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
    are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property
    rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the SOFTWARE
    PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected
    by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.
    This EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT
    contains documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may
    print one copy of such electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed
    materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

  4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant
    to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT
    was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original
    media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make
    one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for backup or archival purposes.
    Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise make copies
    of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE
    PRODUCT.

  5. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S.
    Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is
    provided with the commercial rights and restrictions described elsewhere
    herein. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to
    solicitations issued prior to December 1, 1995 is provided with RESTRICTED
    RIGHTS as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or FAR, 48 CFR
    252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.

  6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US
    Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following
    terms apply: You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE
    PRODUCT, any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct
    product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively referred to as
    the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S.
    export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any of
    the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed
    or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but
    are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
    and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who
    intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such
    country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know
    will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or
    production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person
    or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
    transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and
    represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor any other U.S.
    federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.


MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

This EULA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
United States of America.


LIMITED WARRANTY
----------------

ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)
days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME
shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to
you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not
apply to you.


CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive
remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or
(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs
Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This
Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from
accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be
warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
whichever is longer.

NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.
THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH
VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.
¬†
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,
damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability
to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support
Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be
limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support
Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be
governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not
apply to you.

Educational Community License v2.0
(docker-cli 20180417-snapshot)

Educational Community License
Version 2.0, April 2007
=============================

http://www.osedu.org/licenses/

The Educational Community License version 2.0 ("ECL") consists of the Apache 2.0
license, modified to change the scope of the patent grant in section 3 to be
specific to the needs of the education communities using this license. The
original Apache 2.0 license can be found at:
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
For the purposes of this definition, "control" means

  i.  the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or

  ii.  ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or

  iii.  beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with
respect to contributions by an individual employed by an institution or
organization is limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author
of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the
organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable
grant and research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are
granted.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

  1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

  2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

  3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing
the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable
to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out
of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any
such warranty or additional liability.

Version 2, June 1991
--------------------

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
        be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
        of this License.

      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
    object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
    cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.

  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.
