Python Software Foundation License 2.0
(python-typing-extensions 3.10.0.0, typing 3.7.4.3)

This license was approved as the official PSF License Version 2 on October 22,
2004. The only differences between this and version 1 of the PSF license consist
of removing Python version numbers (like 2.1.1 or 2.3).



PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2
============================================

--------------------------------------------

  1.  This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"),
    and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using
    this software ("Python") in source or binary form and its associated
    documentation.

  2.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
    grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
    reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative
    works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative
    version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
    copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Python Software
    Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
    incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
    work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to
    include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

  4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT
    NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF
    PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
    MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
    THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

  6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
    of its terms and conditions.

  7.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
    Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
    trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products
    or services of Licensee, or any third party.

  8.  By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee agrees to be
    bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
